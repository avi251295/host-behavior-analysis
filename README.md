# host-behavior-analysis
## Introduction
This project aims to provide valuable insights into host behavior within the hospitality industry. By uncovering key differences between super hosts and other hosts and offering actionable recommendations for improvement, we contribute to the enhancement of the hosting experience and the success of hosts in this dynamic industry.

## Problem Statement
The Property Rental Company is facing challenges in increasing its business and attracting more customers. They are looking for effective strategies to expand their operations and enhance their market presence.

## Solution
Analyzing the behavior of different hosts to gain insights on a variety of metrics.

## Strategy
The project involved combining different datasets using SQL and conducting analysis to generate meaningful insights. The findings were then presented in a visually appealing report created in Excel.

## Performance Metrics
.Identity Verified

.Response Times

.Bookings Acceptance Rate

.Number of listings

.Property Type

.Ratings

# Insights
. Booking acceptance should be improved for Non-Super Hosts.

. Host should have a profile pic and verified identity.

. Non-Super Host's performance should be improved by considering Ratings.

. The Company can plan for training programs for other variety of metrics to improve performance of host.

## Methodology

The methodology for creating a dashboard based on the provided CSV data can involve the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Extract the data from the CSV files and load it into a suitable data analysis tool SQL.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis. Perform any necessary data preprocessing tasks.

3. Data Analysis: Utilize descriptive and exploratory data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the data. Calculate summary statistics, visualize data distributions, and explore relationships between variables.

4. Dashboard Development: Develop a dashboard using a suitable visualization tool such as EXCEL. Design the dashboard to effectively communicate the key insights and recommendations derived from the data analysis, utilizing appropriate charts, graphs, and interactive elements.
