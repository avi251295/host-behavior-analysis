The methodology for creating a dashboard based on the provided CSV data can involve the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Extract the data from the CSV files and load it into a suitable data analysis tool SQL.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis. Perform any necessary data preprocessing tasks.

3. Data Analysis: Utilize descriptive and exploratory data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the data. Calculate summary statistics, visualize data distributions, and explore relationships between variables.

4. Dashboard Development: Develop a dashboard using a suitable visualization tool such as EXCEL. Design the dashboard to effectively communicate the key insights and recommendations derived from the data analysis, utilizing appropriate charts, graphs, and interactive elements.
